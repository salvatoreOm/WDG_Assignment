# Technical Writeup: NGO Impact Tracker

## Approach and Architectural Decisions

### System Architecture Overview

The NGO Impact Tracker follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns. The system is designed to handle both individual report submissions and bulk data processing while maintaining data integrity and providing real-time feedback to users.

### Backend Architecture

**Django + REST Framework Choice**: Django was selected for its robust ORM, built-in admin interface, and excellent ecosystem. Django REST Framework provides comprehensive API capabilities with minimal configuration, enabling rapid development while maintaining professional standards.

**Database Design**: The application uses two core models:
- **Report Model**: Stores NGO impact data with a unique constraint on (ngo_id, month) to ensure idempotency. This prevents duplicate submissions and allows for safe retry mechanisms.
- **Job Model**: Tracks background processing status using UUID primary keys for security and scalability. The model includes detailed progress tracking fields and error collection capabilities.

**Asynchronous Processing**: Celery with Redis was implemented to handle CSV uploads asynchronously. This architectural decision prevents timeout issues with large files and provides users with real-time progress updates. The system processes rows individually, collecting errors without stopping the entire batch operation.

### Frontend Architecture

**React + Material-UI**: React provides component reusability and state management, while Material-UI ensures professional design consistency and responsive behavior across devices. The component-based architecture makes the application maintainable and extensible.

**API Integration**: A centralized API service layer handles all backend communication with comprehensive error handling and request/response interceptors. This abstraction makes it easy to modify API behavior and implement features like authentication in the future.

**Real-time Updates**: The bulk upload component implements polling-based progress tracking, updating users every 2 seconds during processing. This provides immediate feedback without requiring complex WebSocket infrastructure.

### Key Technical Decisions

**Idempotency Implementation**: The unique constraint on (ngo_id, month) combined with Django's `update_or_create` method ensures that duplicate reports update existing records rather than creating duplicates. This is crucial for data integrity in a system where NGOs might accidentally submit the same data multiple times.

**Error Handling Strategy**: The system implements comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:
- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- Individual row error collection during CSV processing
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with actionable feedback

**Scalability Considerations**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling through:
- Stateless API design enabling load balancing
- Background task processing that can run on multiple workers
- Database design optimized for read-heavy dashboard queries
- Frontend assets that can be served from CDN

## Production-Grade Improvements

**Infrastructure Enhancements**: In a production environment, the system would benefit from PostgreSQL with read replicas for dashboard queries, Redis Cluster for high availability, and containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability and reliability.

**Security Hardening**: Implementation of JWT-based authentication with role-based access control would restrict dashboard access to authorized personnel. API rate limiting, input sanitization, and HTTPS enforcement would protect against common attacks.

**Monitoring and Observability**: Production deployment would include structured logging with centralized log aggregation, application performance monitoring to track API response times and error rates, and health check endpoints for automated monitoring systems.

**Advanced Features**: Future enhancements could include real-time notifications using WebSockets for instant progress updates, data export capabilities for generating reports, advanced filtering and search functionality, and audit trails for compliance requirements.

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that demonstrates scalable architecture patterns while maintaining simplicity for the demonstration scope. The modular design and clear separation of concerns make it straightforward to implement these production-grade improvements incrementally.
