```

## üñ• UI Features

The application includes:
- **Individual Report Submission**: Clean form with validation
- **Bulk CSV Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with real-time progress tracking
- **Admin Dashboard**: Aggregated metrics with filtering capabilities
- **Status Tracking**: Live updates for background processing jobs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly Material-UI components

## üìù Technical Writeup

### Approach & Architecture

I designed this application with scalability and user experience as primary considerations. The architecture follows a clean separation between frontend and backend, enabling independent scaling and deployment.

**Backend Architecture**: I chose Django REST Framework for rapid API development with built-in validation and serialization. Celery with Redis handles asynchronous CSV processing, preventing timeout issues during bulk uploads. The database design enforces idempotency through unique constraints on (ngo_id, month) pairs, preventing duplicate submissions.

**Frontend Architecture**: React with Material-UI provides a professional, responsive interface. I implemented real-time progress tracking using polling to give users feedback during long-running operations. The component structure is modular and reusable.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Asynchronous processing for scalability
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Progress tracking for better UX
- RESTful API design for clarity

### AI Tools Usage

I leveraged AI assistance primarily for:
- Boilerplate code generation and Django model setup
- API endpoint documentation and validation logic
- Frontend component structure and Material-UI integration
- Error handling patterns and best practices
- Deployment configuration troubleshooting

### Production Improvements

With more time, I would implement:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with role-based access control
- **Database Migration**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling and proper indexing
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for dashboard aggregations
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, health checks, and performance monitoring
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, and HTTPS configuration
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment workflows
